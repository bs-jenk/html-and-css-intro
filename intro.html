            Princess Donut is a tortoiseshell Persian cat who can talk. Although she couldn't talk 
            originally, she gained sentient intelligence after eating an enhanced pet biscuit. 
            She has a very distinctive personality, identifies as a princess, and  loves to get 
            her own way.
